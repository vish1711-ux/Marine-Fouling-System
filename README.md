# Marine-Fouling-System
This AI-powered system automates ship hull fouling detection and maintenance. It uses underwater ROV to get geo-tagged images of the ship hull. This process detects fouling regions and classifies them into specific types, such as algae, barnacles, or slime, and growth stages (early, medium, or advanced).
