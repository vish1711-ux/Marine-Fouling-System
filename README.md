*AIML-Powered-Ship-Hull-Fouling-Detection*
This AI-powered system automates ship hull fouling detection and maintenance. It uses underwater ROVs equipped with RGB and UV cameras to capture high-resolution, geo-tagged images of the ship hull. After preprocessing to correct for distortion and remove noise, deep learning models like CNNs and U-Nets are used for image segmentation. This process detects fouling regions and classifies them into specific types, such as algae, barnacles, or slime, and growth stages (early, medium, or advanced).

The system then computes a fouling density index and assigns a risk score to quantify the severity. These metrics translate the biological accumulation into tangible impacts, such as increased drag, higher fuel consumption, and elevated COâ‚‚ emissions, providing a clear picture of the economic and environmental costs.

Beyond just detection, the system incorporates predictive maintenance forecasting. Using machine learning models, it analyzes growth trends to recommend optimal cleaning schedules, allowing for proactive and cost-effective maintenance planning.

To enhance user experience, the project features 3D hull mapping and AR visualization, creating a digital twin of the ship. Fouling hotspots are overlaid on this model, enabling immersive and interactive inspections. Finally, the system generates automated reports and real-time alerts that provide actionable insights to ship operators and fleet managers.

By combining cutting-edge AI, predictive analytics, and augmented reality, this solution offers a comprehensive and scalable approach to sustainable shipping. It helps maritime industries reduce operational costs while supporting greener practices through informed and timely maintenance.
